S3 - Simple Storage Service 

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, 
data availability, security, and performance. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere.

S3 Components

- Buckets
- Objects
- Bucket Settings
- ACL Settings
- Versioning
- Static Web Hosting with S3
- Replications
- Life Cycle policies
- AWS - Transfer Family // SFTP 
- AWS - Storage Gateway
- AWS - DataSync


Create Bucket

- Every object in S3 is stored in a bucket. To upload files and folders to S3, youâ€™ll need to create a bucket where the objects will be stored.
- Bucket Name should be globally unique

Name - Aja-devops
ACLs - Disabled
Settings - Enabled
Versioning - Disabled 
Create Bucket 

Object 

- Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3.
- There is no limit for the no of objects that you can upload. 
- The Size of each object should not exceed 5tb. 
- We can upload any type of files - code, images, docx, videos

Upload

  Block all public access - off

- Object Ownership

- ACL settings

Select Object
  - Actions
  - Make public using ACL

#Now, once you browse the object URL, you can access the file


Pre-Assigned URL
- A Pre assigned url is generated from s3, without having to modify Bucket settings or ACLS.
which gives access to list and read the particular object for a span of 1-12 Hours
- To generate pre-assigned url
- select object
- Actions
- Share Pre-assigned url 


Bucket Versioning

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. 
You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.
With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures

Edit
- Enable

#Make sure to turn off the Show versions switch before deleting any files.
#If you turn on the show versions switch, it will lead to PD of files

Static Web-Hosting on S3

            ]
        }
    ]
}

- Save

#Once it is saved, now if we browse the s3 web hosting link, we can acess our website

S3 - Replication 

You can use replication to enable automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets.
Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.
You can replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multiple destination buckets. 
The destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket.

To Replicate Objects
- Select Bucket
- Go to MAnagement
- Go to Replication
- Create Replication Rule
- Name 
- Select Source bucket
- select destination bucket
- create IAM role
- Save

#Once the Job is saved, AWS will start moving the data across the buckets. 


S3 - LifeCycle Rules 

AWS S3 Lifecycle Rules are a set of policies that you can define to manage the storage class transitions
and automatic deletion of objects in an S3 bucket. These rules can help reduce storage costs by automatically
moving data to more cost-effective storage classes or removing data when it's no longer needed.

Key Components of S3 Lifecycle Rules

Transitions: Move objects between different S3 storage classes over time.
Expiration: Automatically delete objects after a specified period.
Noncurrent Version Expiration: Expire previous versions of objects in versioned buckets.
Abort Incomplete Multipart Uploads: Automatically abort multipart uploads that are incomplete for a specified time.

S3 Storage Classes

S3 Standard: For frequently accessed data.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering: For data with unpredictable access patterns.
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): For infrequently accessed data.
S3 One Zone-IA: For infrequent access data with low resilience needs.
S3 Glacier: For archival data with retrieval times from minutes to hours.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive: For long-term archival with retrieval times in hours.
S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS): Deprecated and no longer recommended.

Steps to Create S3 Lifecycle Rules

Open the S3 Management Console.\

Select the Bucket: Choose the bucket for which you want to apply lifecycle policies.
Go to the Management Tab: Under your bucket settings, select the Management tab.

Create Lifecycle Rule:

Add Rule: Choose whether you want to create a new rule or modify an existing one.
Configure the Rule: You can define conditions such as:
Prefix (specific folders or objects)
Tags (e.g., only objects with a specific tag)
Object Age (e.g., older than 30 days)

Set Actions:

Transition Actions: Move to another storage class after a certain number of days.
Expiration Actions: Delete objects after a certain number of days.
Noncurrent Version Expiration: Delete older versions of objects in versioned buckets.
Abort Multipart Uploads: Abort uploads that have been incomplete for a specified period.
Review and Save: Review your settings and save the lifecycle rule.

Example of Lifecycle Rule Scenarios

1. Transition Objects to S3 Standard-IA After 30 Days
Prefix: logs/
Action: Move objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days.
2. Delete Objects Older Than 365 Days
Prefix: old-backups/
Action: Expire objects older than 365 days.
3. Archive Data to S3 Glacier After 180 Days and Delete After 365 Days
Prefix: archive/

Action:
Transition objects to S3 Glacier after 180 days.
Expire (delete) the objects after 365 days.
