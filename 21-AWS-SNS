Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that enables
you to send notifications to distributed systems, applications, and users. 
It supports publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging and direct-to-consumer notifications
via multiple protocols like email, SMS, HTTP/S, mobile push, and more.

Key Components of AWS SNS

Topics:

A topic is a communication channel to send messages.
Publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive those messages.
Examples: "High-Priority-Alerts", "Order-Notifications".

Subscribers:
Entities (endpoints) that receive messages from a topic.

Supported protocols include:
Email (plain-text messages).
SMS (text messages to mobile devices).
HTTP/S (webhooks for custom applications).
Amazon SQS (to queue messages).
AWS Lambda (to trigger serverless functions).

Publishers:
Applications, AWS services, or devices that send messages to SNS topics.
Examples: CloudWatch alarms, EC2 Auto Scaling notifications.

Messages:
A message contains data or notifications sent to subscribers.
Supports message attributes to include metadata.
Allows JSON-formatting for protocol-specific customization.

To create an SNS Topic, add an email subscriber, and integrate it with CloudWatch Alarms, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create an SNS Topic
Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the SNS Dashboard.
Click Topics in the left-hand menu.
Click Create Topic.
Configure the SNS Topic:
Type: Standard.
Name: Provide a descriptive name, e.g., ALB-EC2-Monitoring-Topic.
Click Create Topic.

Step 2: Add an Email Subscriber
In the SNS Topic details page, click Create Subscription.
Configure the subscription:
Protocol: Email.
Endpoint: Enter the email address where notifications will be sent (e.g., example@example.com).
Click Create Subscription.
Confirm the subscription:
Check your email inbox for a message from AWS SNS.
Click the confirmation link in the email.

Step 3: Create a CloudWatch Alarm
Go to the CloudWatch Dashboard > Alarms.
Click Create Alarm.
Configure the alarm:
Step 1: Specify Metric:
Choose a metric to monitor (e.g., UnHealthyHostCount for the ALB, CPUUtilization for EC2 instances).
Step 2: Define Threshold:
Set conditions that trigger the alarm (e.g., UnHealthyHostCount > 0 or CPUUtilization > 80%).
Step 3: Configure Actions:
Click Add Notification.
Select your SNS Topic (ALB-EC2-Monitoring-Topic).
Step 4: Add Name and Review:
Provide a meaningful name for the alarm, e.g., ALB-Unhealthy-Host-Alarm.
Click Create Alarm.

Step 4: Test the Setup
To test:
Simulate an issue, such as stopping one EC2 instance to trigger an UnHealthyHostCount alarm.
Alternatively, temporarily set the alarm threshold to match current metrics.
Check your email to verify that the SNS notification is sent when the alarm is triggered.

Step 5: Verify Subscription in the SNS Dashboard
Go to SNS Dashboard > Topics > Select the Topic.
Under Subscriptions, confirm the status is Confirmed.
Ensure your email address is correct.
