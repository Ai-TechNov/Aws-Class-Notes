AWS - NatGateWay

- NAT Gateway is a highly available AWS managed service that makes it easy to connect to the Internet 
from instances within a private subnet in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). 
Previously, you needed to launch a NAT instance to enable NAT for instances in a private subnet.
