A bastion host is a server that acts as a secure gateway to a private network from an external network, 
such as the internet. It's designed to withstand cyberattacks and provide a secure entry point for remote access


#LAuching 2 ec2 instances in 2 diff Pvt-Subnets

- Launch 1st ec2 in Dell Pvt 
- Launch 2nd ec2 in aja pvt

#In order to connect to these Pvt Ec2, we need a bastion host or a Jump server.

- A bastion host is a special computer that plays the role of a gatekeeper between a device and your private network. Due to potential blocking of internet traffic by the internal network and hosted services, SSH may be the only means to access these services.
