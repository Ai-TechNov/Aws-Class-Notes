VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined.
This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Internet-Gateway

An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It does not cause availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

Subnets

A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network.
Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting,
network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.

Route-tables

A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
